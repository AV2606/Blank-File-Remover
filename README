Cant directly upload your project because of an empty file?
No more!

With the Blank Files Remover this issue belongs to the past.
The BFR will take your Folder and remove every blank file it has in it and its sub-folders! (empty folders does not included)
Just pop up the app and free these annoying 2 minutes before the upload to github.
